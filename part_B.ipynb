    "The third approach, using NumPy's std() function, which is a pre-existing Python function, is the most effective for calculating the standard deviation of all three sequences. However, as observed from the time computed from each loop, the length of the sequence plays an important role in determine the fastest approach. Although the third approach (NumPy) was the fastets overall, the fist loop in approach 3 had a longer run-time compared to both approach 1 (manual loop) and 2 (built-in functions). \n",
    "\n",
    "Pythons loops process one element at a time, while NumPy operations process entire arrays in bulk. When using the std() function, NumPy avoids unnecessary operations, making it faster than summing and looping through the data. However, for shorter sequences, it takes longer to run the loop with NumPy because of its advanced features. In conclution, for shorter sequences, built-in functions such as sum() and len() tend to be more efficient. However, for longer sequences, NumPy is by far the most effective. "
